# KQL Query Collection

This repository contains various Sentinel/Log Analytics KQL queries that Iâ€™ve created for different tasks and projects. More will be added as and when I create them.

## Overview

- [**SentinelHealth**](./SentinelHealth) - Queries for monitoring [`Sentinel health`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/monitor-data-connector-health). For example, data connectors.
- [**SigninLogs**](./SigninLogs) - Queries for investigating sign-in activity using the `SigninLogs` table. Useful for detecting suspicious logins, failed attempts, and geographic anomalies, etc.

## AI/LLM Summary

If you'd prefer to pass all of the queries in this repo to a LLM or AI tool like Claude or ChatGPT, you can download the [repository_context.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dstreefkerk/kql/refs/heads/master/repository_context.md) file. It's an auto-generated merged representation of all of the KQL queries within this repo.
